-- has three different profiles: NFW, SIS, Hernquist with same DM mass w.in R200 as NFW and same inner slot (see Springel et al 2005).  Specified by PROFILE_TYPE
-- has correct specification of Vmax and sigma for NFW profile from Zentner & Bullock 2003
-- has correct spec for vp200 for different profiles
-- concentration of satellites now a function of mass (Maccio et al. 2008)
-- in subroutine derivs: logLambda=max(0.D0,log(Lambda))  ! to avoid problem in accdf when r < Rsat 
-- checked masses agree with masses in Gadget.
-- if using more than 3 satellites, steps needs to be more than 100.

Checks:
1) This code to the best of my knowledge reproduces the correct satellite positions 
2) Recovers results in Besla et al. 2007, K13, Sohn et al. 2013.
